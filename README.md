# 📚 Learning Goal Tracker

An iOS application built with **SwiftUI** to help users set learning goals and track their daily progress.  
The app encourages consistent learning through a **streak system**, supports **freezing days** to keep your streak, and includes a **weekly calendar** to visualize progress. It features a modern **glass effect** UI inspired by iOS 18 design trends.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Set your **learning goal** (e.g., learn Swift for a month).  
2. Each day you complete learning, tap **“Log as Learned”** 🔥.  
3. If you can’t learn that day, tap **“Freeze Current Day”** 🧊 to keep your streak.  
4. Track your progress in the **weekly calendar**.  
5. When your goal is completed:
   - ✨ **Set a new learning goal**, or  
   - 🔁 **Keep the same goal** and reset your streak.
